# youtube-popularity-stats

Media in the last 10 years has underwent considerable changes. Tv is no longer the dominant medium for news, entertainment, and sports. Currently tv faces a competitive challenge across mediums in the form of the internet and smart phones. The internet provides consumers an endless supply  of web entertainment while smart phones supplement these outlets with social media, apps, commerce, etc. The common variable that I’ve identified across smartphones and web media is Youtube. In some ways youtube can serve as a consumer’s only form of entertainment. It can be your music player, study resource, sports channel, and news all in one. 

 What I seek to accomplish with this project is the task of aggregating and analyzing viewer trends in order to bring insight into what content viewers prefer . The dataset that I have consulted, us_data.csv, provides us with a compilation of videos that have met youtube’s trending criteria.
 
  In addition I seek to unpack the notion of ‘trending’ and how it compares against subscriber count and additional variables for the purpose of illustrating the ways that large media companies have used the platform to its fullest capabilities to achieve maximum visibility. 
  
  Questions
  
  
  
*Is an ‘trending’ overrated term? Ie does subscriber count mean more than overall viewership.


*How do smaller accounts compete for an audience against large media entities.


*Can viewer patterns be established (ie does movie subcategory out perform the comedy subcategory)


*Do channels with specific audiences outperform those with broader reach.


*For advertising purposes, what are the better pages to target. 




H0: Trending is the best measure viewer preference  
HA: Trending is not the best measure of viewer preference
